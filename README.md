Pathfinding Visualizer  
This is a small maze and pathfinding visualizer built with React and TypeScript.  
The app lets you generate random mazes and watch how different algorithms explore and solve them.

Features

-   Maze generation using recursive backtracking
-   Supports multiple pathfinding algorithms:
    -   A\* (A-Star)
    -   Dijkstra's Algorithm
    -   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    -   Depth-First Search (DFS)
-   Step-by-step visual animation of each algorithm
-   Click to remove walls and create custom paths
-   Fixed start and end points
-   Simple and clean grid layout
